                                            this layout, defines this placeholder, arbitrarily called body, bc 100% content of body is there

                                            ,jinja in templates: authors of flask decided for there template feature, they would not reinvent the wheel
                                            and come up with there own syntax, flask uses s.o. else´s crazy syntax, so there are using
                                            and , they are just combining one persons language with other, you can 
                                            plug in other languages as well, if you don´t like jinja... this concept - component based
                                            design, plug pieces of SW together and have them still interoperate - is pretty common
