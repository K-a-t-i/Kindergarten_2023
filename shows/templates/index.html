<!--involving js with jQuery (decreasing in popularity, still used by bootstrap) -->
<!--add script tag into my own pages head-->
<!--only one input, that why it works with querySelector-->
<!--listens for the keyup event, user touching and letting go of the key, when the user does this I wanna call funktion
what we do in this functon we call another function with $.get("") equals shorhand notation for jQuery.get
with "search..."dynamically constructing in JavaScript code the URL that I want to requst shows from,  /search?q=, 
whatever the value of the input box was that the user typed sth into
how $sign works is it supports whatÂ´s called a callback, it is a function that will eventually be called when it has an answer for you
when we calling from a other server, the browser will not froze while waiting for response, lot nicer when you can say, when you have the data
call me back, like on the phone, call me back be calling this funktion
what fucntion do I wanted to call, fuction going to take as an input an argument called shows
html string that is initally nothing
for loop letting a variable called ID = whatever ID is in the shows that just came back to me, and now inside of this loop, create a title = shwos, which is
the date which came back through that call bakc
what are we doing:
we've got a simple web page with an unordered list thats currently empty
below that, we're including this 3rd party JavaScript library called jQuery
which Bootstrap also happens to use for some of its graphical oomponents
Than own JavaScript code that first declares a varible thats give me access
to the input tag on my own webpage, a few lines above
then using this fancy function dollar sign get to do waht's called an AJAX call
AJAX refers to the ability for a web page to make  additional http requests programmatically (programmgesteuert) to a server
it is allowing, this is how all websites today get your chat messages if a friend just messaed you on some platform
It is how when you are typing in your address, it can autocomplete your address based on the entire globes worth of addresses
It is how Google search autocoplete works as well
$.get is a fuction built into jQuery that is using some standard JavaScript functionallity thats going allow me to visit the URL that end with /search?q= what ever the human typed in
and when the response is ready, this anonymous fuction an argument called shows that is going to equal this stuff (list, array which is in a list of dictionaries or objects with two keys, ID and title
)
this happens in javaScript iterating of such a data structure (for loop) 
html +=... allowing me to create one line after another, another li, another li appending it using concationation to this variable called html
document.querySe... says to the browser, go select me that ul and plug into its inner html the contents of it, the alue of my variable
